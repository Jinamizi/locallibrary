ListView
override
get_queryset - to change the list of records returned
get_context_data(self, **kwargs) - in order to pass additional context variables to the template
When doing this it is important to follow the pattern used above:

First get the existing context from our superclass.
Then add your new context information.
Then return the new (updated) context.

{% empty %} used to define what happens if the book_list is empty.

within the for loop Django will also create other variables that you can use to track the iteration
forloop.last - perform conditional processing the last time that the loop is run.
forloop.counter #starting index 1
forloop.counter0 #starting index 0
forloop.parentloop
